# Student Group Finder

This project is a simple web page that helps determine which group a student belongs to based on their birth date. The groups are classified as follows:
- K1 class: Students born between May 16, 2021, and May 16, 2022
- K2 class: Students born between May 17, 2022, and May 16, 2023
- K3 class: Students born between May 17, 2023, and May 16, 2024

## Files Included
- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the form and JavaScript to determine the student group.

## How to Use
1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Enter the student's birth date in the provided date input field.
3. Click the "Find Group" button to determine which group the student belongs to.
4. The result will be displayed below the form, indicating the class (K1, K2, or K3) the student belongs to based on their birth date.

## Code Explanation
The `index.html` file contains the following key elements:

### HTML Structure
- A form with a date input field for the user to enter the student's birth date.
- A submit button to trigger the group finding process.
- A paragraph element to display the result.

### JavaScript Logic
- An event listener is added to the form to handle the submit event.
- When the form is submitted, the birth date entered by the user is retrieved and compared against predefined date ranges for each class.
- Based on the birth date, the appropriate group (K1, K2, or K3) is determined and displayed in the result paragraph.

### Example
Here is an example of how the form works:
1. The user enters a birth date, e.g., `2022-06-15`.
2. The script checks the date and determines that this date falls within the K2 class date range.
3. The result displayed will be: "The student belongs to: K2 class".

## Requirements
